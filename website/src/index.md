OSRS CLI is a [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) app for Old School RuneScape, with numerous calculators, tools, and more. To get started, [install the app locally](/install), then check out the [user guide](/guide) for instructions.

Or, **try it right here and now!** (Disclaimer: not all commands work in the browser yet, I'm trying my best)

This is a fully fledged version of the CLI, exactly what you get when you install locally (barring a few small differences). Your configuration will be saved in your browser for safe keeping. ~~You can import and export your configuration from here to share with other browsers or a native installation.~~ Coming Soonâ„¢

Want more space? [Try the fullscreen version](/terminal).
